## Features

## Instructions

osr.py

2) Copy gdal18.dll to Desktop10.3\bin

3) In ArcCatalog navigate to MyToolboxes, right click, and create a new toolbox and name it "GeoPackage". Copy the Raster2gpkg tool from the GeoPackageToolbox.tbx\GeoPackage to the GeoPackage toolbox under My Toolboxes.

4) Load the image into a geopackage (.gpkg)

 - Select the image type. (jpeg, png).
